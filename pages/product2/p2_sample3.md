We've seen numbers in Python, but how do we go about using them? In this lesson, we'll learn about the various numeric operators that we'll use in our Python programs.

### The Numeric Operators
When we think about what we can do with numbers in math, there are quite a few things that come to mind such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. All of those actions are carried out in our programs by using "operators", special characters we put between the two numbers that carry out a specific calculation. In Python, and in most programming languages, there are more operators than we would typically use when doing arithmetic. Here are the most common operators used in the REPL:

```cmd
>>> 2 + 2 # Addition
4
>>> 10 - 4 # Subtraction
6
>>> 3 * 9 # Multiplication
27
>>> 5 / 3 # Division, converts the result to a float even when evenly divided.
1.66666666666667
>>> 5 // 3 # Floor division, always returns a number without a remainder as an int
1
>>> 8 % 3 # Modulo division, returns the remainder as an int
2
>>> 2 ** 3 # Exponent
8
```

There are even more operators than this, but they don't all apply to numbers. We'll learn about some of the other operators in different lessons.
