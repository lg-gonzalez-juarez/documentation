## 2.2 Origins

Elektro, 1936, Electric house
Talos, greek mithology
1945, Alan Turing

Can machine think? by A.M. Turing

The fist use of the term "Artificial intelligence" was founded in the proposal for the Dartmouth summer research project on Artificial intelligence at 1955

## 2.3 Machine Learning

Arthur Samuel, in 1959, he created a checker playing program. That was one of the first examples of a self-learning program. This contained the first concepts relative to reiforcement learning
