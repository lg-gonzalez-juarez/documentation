{% include callout.html content="**Important information**: This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. <br/><br/>Here I am starting a new paragraph, because I have lots of information to share. You may wonder why I'm using line breaks instead of paragraph tags. This is because Kramdown processes the Markdown here as a span rather than a div (for whatever reason). Be grateful that you can be using Markdown at all inside of HTML. That's usually not allowed in Markdown syntax, but it's allowed here." type="primary" %}
