<h2 id="theme-options">Theme options</h2>
<p>You can choose a green or blue theme, or you can create your own. In the css folder, there are two theme files: theme-blue.css and theme-green.css. These files have the most common CSS elements extracted in their own CSS file. Just change the hex colors to the ones you want.</p>

<p>In the _includes/head.html file, specify the theme file you want the output to use â€” for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">theme_file: theme-green.css</code>. See this line:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"css/theme-green.css"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="theme-differences">Theme differences</h2>
<p>The differences between the themes is fairly minimal. The main navigation bar, sidebar, buttons, and heading colors change color. Thatâ€™s about it.</p>

<p>In a more sophisticated theming approach, you could use Sass files to generate rules based on options set in a data file, but I kept things simple here.</p>
