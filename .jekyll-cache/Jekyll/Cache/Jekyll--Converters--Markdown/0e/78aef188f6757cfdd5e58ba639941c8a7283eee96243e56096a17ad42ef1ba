<p>The compiler would be something that produces machine code. So at its core, what a compiler does is it takes code from one type, transfers it into a different type. So most of the time, this is going to be going from a high-level language like Python or something else down to something that is lower level and can run on the machine directly, or it can run in a virtual machine. So that‚Äôs what a compiler does; it just translates code from one type of code to another type of code. That‚Äôs the simplified version of this, and there are many different types of compilers that can exist, and we‚Äôre not going to cover all of them.We just need to loosely know what a compiler does,but the compilation process consist of five basic steps here.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-repl">Using the REPL</h2>
<p><a href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/5262/lesson/4/module/413">LinuxAcademy</a>
Python is an interpreted language, and code is evaluated in a line-by-line fashion. Since each line can be evaluated by itself, the time between evaluating each line doesn‚Äôt matter, and this allows us to have a REPL.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html">Python Interpreter</a></p>

<p>What is a REPL?
REPL stands for: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop</p>

<p>Each line is read and evaluated, the return value is printed to the screen, and then the process repeats.</p>

<p>Python ships with a REPL and you can access it by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3.7</code> from your terminal.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;&gt;p</code> indicates that you can type on that line. Later on, you‚Äôll also see a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...</code> which means that you are currently in a scoped area and will need to enter a blank line (no spaces) before it will evaluate the entire code block.</p>

<p>The simplest use of this would be to do some math:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code> is the return value of the expression and it is then printed to the screen. If something doesn‚Äôt have a return value, then nothing will be printed to the screen and you‚Äôll see the next prompt immediately. We‚Äôll cover this later, but an example would be None:</p>

<p>To exit the REPL, you can either type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit()</code> (the parentheses are important) or you can hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+d</code> on your keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-python-file">Creating a Python File</h2>
<p><a href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/5262/lesson/5/module/413">info</a></p>

<p>Since this is a course about Python scripting, we will be writing the majority of our code in scripts instead of using the REPL. To create a Python script we can create a file ending with the file extension of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.py</code>.</p>

<h3 id="creating-our-first-python-script">Creating Our First Python Script</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs create our first script to write our obligatory ‚ÄúHello, 
World!‚Äù program, calling it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.py</code>.</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">touch hello.py
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>From inside this file, we can enter the lines of Python that we need. For the ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù example we only need</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/code/hello.py
print<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a few different pays that we can run this file. The first is by passing it to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3.7</code> CLI.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>python3.7 hello.py
Hello, World!
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="setting-a-shebang">Setting a Shebang</h3>
<p>We‚Äôll most likely want our scripts to be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Executable from anywhere (in our $PATH)</li>
  <li>Executable without explicitly using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3.7</code> CLI</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully, we can set the process to interpret our scripts by setting a shebang at the top of the file:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.py:</code></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env python3.7</span>
print<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, World"</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We‚Äôre not quite done. Now we need to make the file executable using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod:</code></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">chmod </span>u+x hello.py
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Run the script now by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./hello.py</code> and we‚Äôll see the same result. If we‚Äôd rather not have a file extension on our script, we can remove it since we‚Äôve put a shebang in the file. Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv hello.py</code> hello then performing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./hello</code> will still result in the same thing.</p>
