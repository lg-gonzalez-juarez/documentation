<h3 id="the-while-loop">The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code> Loop</h3>

<p>We work with collections of data and sequence a lot in programming, and it is common for us to want to perform the same action on each item or a subset of items in the content. To handle this, we need iteration and looping. In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn about one type of loop that we can use: the while loop.</p>

<h3 id="the-while-loop-1">The while Loop</h3>

<p>The most basic type of loop that we have at our disposal is the while loop. This type of loop repeats itself based on a condition that we pass to it. Here‚Äôs the general structure of a while loop:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">while CONDITION:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>The CONDITION in this statement works the same way that it does for an if statement. When we demonstrated the if statement, we first tried it by simply passing in True as the condition. Let‚Äôs see when we try that same condition with a while loop:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; while True:
...     print("looping")
...
looping
looping
looping
looping
</code></pre>

<p>That loop will continue forever, we‚Äôve created an infinite loop. To stop the loop, press Ctrl-C. Infinite loops are one of the potential problems with while loops. If we don‚Äôt use a condition that we can change from within the loop, then it will continue forever if it‚Äôs initially true. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll normally approach using a while loop, where we modify something about the condition on each iteration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; count = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; while count &lt;= 4:
...     print("looping")
...     count += 1
...
looping

&gt;&gt;&gt;

<p>## The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> Loop</p>

<p>We work with collections of data and sequence a lot in programming, and it is common for us to want to perform the same action on each item or a subset of items in the content. To handle this we need iteration and looping. In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn about the most common type of loop that we will use: the for loop.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-for-this-video-1">Documentation For This Video</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements">The for statement</a></p>

<h3 id="the-for-loop">The for Loop</h3>
<p>The most common use we have for looping is when we want to execute some code for each item in a sequence. For this type of looping or iteration, we‚Äôll use the for loop. The general structure for a for loop is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">for TEMP_VAR in SEQUENCE:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>The TEMP_VAR will be populated with each item as we iterate through the SEQUENCE, and it will be available to us in the context of the loop. After the loop finishes one iteration, then the TEMP_VAR will be populated with the next item in the SEQUENCE, and the loop‚Äôs body will execute again. This process continues until we either hit a break statement or we‚Äôve iterated over every item in the SEQUENCE. Here‚Äôs an example that loops over a list of colors:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; colors = ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'purple']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for color in colors:
...     print(color)
...
blue
green
red
purple
&gt;&gt;&gt; color
'purple'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="other-iterable-types">Other Iterable Types</h3>

<p>Lists will be the most common type that we iterate over using a for loop, but we can also iterate over other sequence types. Of the types we already know, we can iterate over strings, dictionaries, and tuples.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a tuple example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; point = (2.1, 3.2, 7.6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for value in point:
...     print(value)
...
2.1
3.2
7.6
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this dictionary example, by default, will first unpack each key:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; ages = {'kevin': 59, 'bob': 40, 'kayla': 21}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for key in ages:
...     print(key)
...
kevin
bob
kayla
</code></pre>

<p>If we leverage what we‚Äôve learned about dictionaries, we can actually get the key and value on each iteration by using dict.items and unpacking the tuple in each iteration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; for key, value in ages.items():
...     print(key, value)
...
kevin 59
bob 40
kayla 21
</code></pre>

<p>A string example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; for letter in "my_string":
...     print(letter)
...
m
y
_
s
t
r
i
n
g
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="nesting-loops-and-conditionals">Nesting Loops and Conditionals</h2>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve learned how to use loops and conditionals, we can do a lot more with our programs. We can do even more when we combine them by nesting loops within conditionals or conditionals within loops.</p>

<h3 id="nesting-conditionals-within-loops">Nesting Conditionals within Loops</h3>

<p>We‚Äôve seen two of the most common types of code contexts in Python: the body of a conditional and the body of a loop. To signify code contexts in Python, we use indentation. If we need to nest contexts, like conditionals or loops, then we can add more indentation. Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre looping through a list of numbers, and we only want to print the number if it‚Äôs a multiple of 4. In this case, we can add a conditional check within our loop:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; counter = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; while counter &lt;= 25:
...     if counter % 4 == 0:
...         print(counter)
...     counter += 1
...
4
8
12
16
20
24
</code></pre>

<p>For each nested context, we‚Äôll need to indent an extra 4 spaces. When we‚Äôre done doing what we need to do in a nested context, then we go back to the previous indentation level to continue at that level. This is how we‚Äôre able to continue past the if statement to increment the counter, all still within the while loop.</p>

<h3 id="controlling-loop-execution-with-break-and-continue">Controlling Loop Execution with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">break</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continue</code></h3>

<p>There are times while working with loops, that we want to skip a single iteration, or even completely stop a loop before it is finished. We can accomplish these two things by using the continue and break statements.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-for-this-video-2">Documentation For This Video</h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops">The break and continue statements</a></p>

<h3 id="the-continue-and-break-statements">The continue and break Statements</h3>

<p>If we want to continue to the next iteration in a nested context or stop the loop entirely, we have access to the continue and break keywords:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; count = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while count &lt; 10:
...     if count % 2 == 0:
...         count += 1
...         continue
...     print(f"We're counting odd numbers: {count}")
...     count += 1
...
We're counting odd numbers: 1
We're counting odd numbers: 3
We're counting odd numbers: 5
We're counting odd numbers: 7
We're counting odd numbers: 9
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The continue statement will cause the nearest loop (if we have nested loops) to go directly to the next iteration. This means that we will not execute any of the remaining lines of the loop for the current iteration. This can be an issue if we continue without incrementing the count value in our example loop‚Äôs conditional.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre demonstrating ‚Äústring interpolation‚Äù in Python 3 by prefixing a string literal with an f and then using curly braces to substitute in variables or expressions (in this case, the count value).</p>

<p>The break statement works similarly to the continue statement in that it keeps our current iteration from executing the remaining lines in the loop, but it also causes the entire loop to stop.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example using the break statement:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; count = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; while count &lt; 10:
...     if count % 2 == 0:
...         break
...     print(f"We're counting odd numbers: {count}")
...     count += 1
...
We're counting odd numbers: 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-break-and-continue-with-a-for-loop">Using break and continue with a for Loop</h3>

<p>The break and continue statements work with for loops as well. If we didn‚Äôt want to print out certain colors, we could utilize the continue or break statements again. Let‚Äôs say we want to skip the string ‚Äòblue‚Äô and terminate the loop if we see the string ‚Äòred‚Äô:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; colors = ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'purple']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for color in colors:
...     if color == 'blue':
...         continue
...     elif color == 'red':
...         break
...     print(color)
...
green
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="integrating-else-with-loops">Integrating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> with Loops</h2>

<p>Unlike many languages, loops in Python have an additional clause that we can use: the else clause. In this lesson, we‚Äôll take a look at why and when we might want to use this additional Python feature.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-for-this-video-3">Documentation For This Video</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops">The break and continue statements and the else clause</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-else-clause">The else Clause</h2>

<p>The else clause for loops in Python allows us to define an additional code context that will execute when the loop has naturally finished its iteration. In a for loop, this means that we‚Äôve reached the end of our iteration, and in a while loop it means the conditional has evaluated to False. Here‚Äôs an example for each of these:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; counter = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; while counter &lt;= 4:
...     print(counter)
...     counter += 1
... else:
...     print("While loop completed")
...
1
2
3
4
While loop completed
</code></pre>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
...     print(i)
... else:
...     print("For loop completed")
...
1
2
3
4
5
For loop completed
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This might seem a little useless because we could have just as easily written these additional print statements on the line directly following the loop and achieved the same result. That‚Äôs true. The else clause isn‚Äôt that valuable unless we utilize it in conjunction with the break statement. The else clause‚Äôs body will execute if the break statement is not hit. We can leverage this when we‚Äôre iterating through a list:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; colors = ['red', 'pink', 'blue', 'orange', 'green']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for color in colors:
...     if color == 'orange':
...         print("Orange is in the list")
...         break
... else:
...     print("Orange is not in the list")
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="orange-is-in-the-list">Orange is in the list</h3>
<p>This is not the most efficient way to search through a list, but it‚Äôs a good example of when the else clause of a loop has an effect besides just being the expression run after the loop.</p>
