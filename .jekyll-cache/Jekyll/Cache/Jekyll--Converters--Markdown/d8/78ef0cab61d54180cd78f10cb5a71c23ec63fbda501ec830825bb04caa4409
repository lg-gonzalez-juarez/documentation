<p>We need to constantly evaluate a condition of some kind to determine what action to take or what value to assign to a variable weâ€™ll use later in our program. In the situation where we only have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> and an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code>, and the body of each branch contains only one expression, then weâ€™re able to use a conditional expression. Conditional expressions can be used to succinctly express a simple conditional. In this hands-on lab, weâ€™ll be refactoring an existing script by rewriting the simple conditional statements as conditional expressions.</p>

<h1 id="scenario">Scenario</h1>

<p>Because weâ€™re refactoring an existing script, our goal is to not change what happens when we run the script. To run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">process_name.py</code>, weâ€™ll pass it to our Python interpreter and then answer a few questions.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 processing_items.py
What is your first name? Keith
Your name is shorter than the average first name in the United States
The first letter of your name is not among the five most common
K is a consonant
e is a vowel
i is a vowel
t is a consonant
h is a consonant
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Weâ€™re going to rewrite the conditional statements that are used in the process_name.py script to be conditional expressions instead. Weâ€™re able to do this only because each branch in the conditionals has just one expression.</p>

<p>Log In Using VS Code in the Browser
Navigate to the provided public IP address on port 8080 (e.g. http://PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS:8080).
Call print with a Different String Using a Single Conditional Expression
Under the File menu, select Open Fileâ€¦.</p>

<p>Select the process_name.py file from the list that appears.</p>

<p>Under the Terminal menu, select New Terminal.</p>

<p>In the terminal, run the script.</p>

<p>python3.7 process_name.py
Enter your name and examine the results.</p>

<p>Change the code under the first task description to the following.</p>

<p>print(
    â€œYour name is as long or longer than the average first name in the United Statesâ€
) if len(name) &gt;= 6 else print (
    â€œYour name is shorter than the average first name in the United Statesâ€
)
Save the changes.</p>

<p>Rerun the script in the terminal and verify the results using names of various length.</p>

<p>python3.7 process_name.py
Assign a Value to the message Variable Based on a Conditional Expression
Change the code under the second task description to the following.</p>

<p>message = (
    â€œThe first letter in your name is among the five most commonâ€
    if name[0].lower() in [â€œaâ€, â€œjâ€, â€œmâ€, â€œeâ€, â€œlâ€]
    else â€œThe first letter of your name is not among the five most commonâ€
)
Save the changes.</p>

<p>Rerun the script in the terminal and verify the results using different names.</p>

<p>python3.7 process_name.py
Change the String Passed to the print Function Using a Conditional Expression
Change the code under the third task description to the following.</p>

<p>for letter in name:
    print(
        fâ€{letter} {â€˜is a vowelâ€™ if letter.lower() in [â€˜aâ€™, â€˜eâ€™, â€˜iâ€™, â€˜oâ€™, â€˜uâ€™] else â€˜is a consonantâ€™}â€
    )
Save the changes.</p>

<p>Rerun the script in the terminal and verify the results using different names.</p>
