<h3 id="address-already-in-use">Address already in use</h3>

<p>When you try to build the site, you get this error in iTerm:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll 2.5.3 | Error:  Address already in use - bind(2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This happens if a server is already in use. To fix this, edit your config file and change the port to a unique number.</p>

<p>If the previous server wasn‚Äôt shut down properly, you can kill the server process using these commands:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ps aux | grep jekyll</code></p>

<p>Find the PID (for example, it  looks like ‚Äú22298‚Äù).</p>

<p>Then type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kill -9 22298</code> where ‚Äú22298‚Äù is the PID.</p>

<p>Alternatively, type the following to stop all Jekyll servers:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="shell-file-not-executable">shell file not executable</h3>

<p>If you run into permissions errors trying to run a shell script file (such as mydoc_multibuild_web.sh), you may need to change the file permissions to make the sh file executable. Browse to the directory containing the shell script and run the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>chmod +x build_writer.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="shell-file-not-runnable">shell file not runnable</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre using a PC, rename your shell files with a .bat extension.</p>

<h3 id="page-0-cross-references-in-the-pdf">‚Äúpage 0‚Äù cross references in the PDF</h3>

<p>If you see ‚Äúpage 0‚Äù cross-references in the PDF, the URL doesn‚Äôt exist. Check to make sure you actually included this page in the build.</p>

<p>If it‚Äôs not a page but rather a file, you need to add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">noCrossRef</code> class to the file so that your print stylesheet excludes the counter from it. Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class="noCrossRef"</code> as an attribute to the link. In the css/printstyles.css file, there is a style that should remove the counter from anchor elements with this class.</p>

<h3 id="the-pdf-is-blank">The PDF is blank</h3>

<p>Check the prince-list.txt file in the output to see if it contains links. If not, you have something wrong with the logic in the prince-list.txt file. Check the conditions.html file in your _includes to see if the audience specified in your configuration file aligns with the buildAudience in the conditions.html file</p>

<h3 id="sidebar-not-appearing">Sidebar not appearing</h3>

<p>If you build your site but the sidebar doesn‚Äôt appear, check the following:</p>

<p>Look in your PDF config file and make sure you have a sidebar property, such as this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pdf_sidebar: product2_sidebar
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Make sure each TOC item has an output property that specifies web or pdf.</p>

<p>Understanding how the theme works can be helpful in troubleshooting. The _includes/sidebar.html file loops through the values in the _data/sidebar.yml file. There are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statements that check whether the conditions (as specified in the conditions.html file) are met. If the sidebar.yml item doesn‚Äôt have the right output, then it won‚Äôt get displayed in the sidebar. It would instead get skipped.</p>

<h3 id="sidebar-isnt-collapsed">Sidebar isn‚Äôt collapsed</h3>

<p>If the sidebar levels aren‚Äôt collapsed, usually your JavaScript is broken somewhere. Open the JavaScript Console and look to see where the problem is. If one script breaks, then other scripts will break too, so troubleshooting it is a little tricky.</p>

<h3 id="search-isnt-working">Search isn‚Äôt working</h3>

<p>If the search isn‚Äôt working, check the JSON validity in the search.json file in your output folder. Usually something is invalid. Identify the problematic line, fix the file, or put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search: exclude</code> in the frontmatter of the file to exclude it from search.</p>
