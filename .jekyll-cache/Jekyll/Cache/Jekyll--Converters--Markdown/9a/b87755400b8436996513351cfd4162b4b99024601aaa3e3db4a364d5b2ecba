<p>The compiler would be something that produces machine code. So at its core, what a compiler does is it takes code from one type, transfers it into a different type. So most of the time, this is going to be going from a high-level language like Python or something else down to something that is lower level and can run on the machine directly, or it can run in a virtual machine. So that’s what a compiler does; it just translates code from one type of code to another type of code. That’s the simplified version of this, and there are many different types of compilers that can exist, and we’re not going to cover all of them.We just need to loosely know what a compiler does,but the compilation process consist of five basic steps here.</p>

<p><a href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/5262/lesson/4/module/413">LinuxAcademy</a>
Python is an interpreted language, and code is evaluated in a line-by-line fashion. Since each line can be evaluated by itself, the time between evaluating each line doesn’t matter, and this allows us to have a REPL.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html">Python Interpreter</a></p>

<p>What is a REPL?
REPL stands for: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop</p>

<p>Each line is read and evaluated, the return value is printed to the screen, and then the process repeats.</p>

<p>Python ships with a REPL and you can access it by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3.7</code> from your terminal.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;&gt;p</code> indicates that you can type on that line. Later on, you’ll also see a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...</code> which means that you are currently in a scoped area and will need to enter a blank line (no spaces) before it will evaluate the entire code block.</p>

<p>The simplest use of this would be to do some math:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code> is the return value of the expression and it is then printed to the screen. If something doesn’t have a return value, then nothing will be printed to the screen and you’ll see the next prompt immediately. We’ll cover this later, but an example would be None:</p>

<p>To exit the REPL, you can either type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit()</code> (the parentheses are important) or you can hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+d</code> on your keyboard.</p>

<p><a href="https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/5262/lesson/5/module/413">info</a></p>

<p>Since this is a course about Python scripting, we will be writing the majority of our code in scripts instead of using the REPL. To create a Python script we can create a file ending with the file extension of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.py</code>.</p>

<h3 id="creating-our-first-python-script">Creating Our First Python Script</h3>
<p>Let’s create our first script to write our obligatory “Hello, 
World!” program, calling it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.py</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">touch</span> <span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>From inside this file, we can enter the lines of Python that we need. For the “Hello, World!” example we only need</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/code/hello.py
</code></pre></div></div>
