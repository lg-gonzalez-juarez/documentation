There a excellent blog on technical writing called <a alt="technical writing blog" href="http://idratherbewriting.com">Iâ€™d Rather Be Writing</a>. If youâ€™d like to stay updated with the latest trends, best practices, and other methods for writing documentation, consider <a href="https://tinyletter.com/tomjoht">subscribing</a>.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary"><strong>Important information</strong>: This is my callout. It has a border on the left whose color you define by passing a type parameter. I typically use this style of callout when I have more information that I want to share, often spanning multiple paragraphs. <br /><br />Here I am starting a new paragraph, because I have lots of information to share. You may wonder why Iâ€™m using line breaks instead of paragraph tags. This is because Kramdown processes the Markdown here as a span rather than a div (for whatever reason). Be grateful that you can be using Markdown at all inside of HTML. Thatâ€™s usually not allowed in Markdown syntax, but itâ€™s allowed here.</div>
