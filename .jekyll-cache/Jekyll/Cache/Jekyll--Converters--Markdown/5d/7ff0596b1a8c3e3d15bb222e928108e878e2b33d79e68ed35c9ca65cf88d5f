<h3 id="defining-and-using-functions">Defining and Using Functions</h3>

<p>Being able to write code that we can call multiple times without repeating ourselves is one of the most powerful things that we can do when programming. Let‚Äôs learn how to define functions in Python.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-for-this-video">Documentation For This Video</h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions">Defining Functions</a></p>

<h3 id="function-basics-1">Function Basics</h3>

<p>We can create functions in Python using the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The def keyword</li>
  <li>The function name - lowercase starting with a letter or underscore (_)</li>
  <li>Left parenthesis (()</li>
  <li>0 or more parameter names</li>
  <li>Right parenthesis ())</li>
  <li>A colon :</li>
  <li>An indented function body</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example without any parameters:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def hello_world():
...     print("Hello, World!")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; hello_world()
Hello, World!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to define a parameter, we will put the variable name we want it to have within the parentheses:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def print_name(name):
...     print(f"Name is {name}")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_name("Keith")
Name is Keith
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let‚Äôs try to assign the value from print_name to a variable called output:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; output = print_name("Keith")
Name is Keith
&gt;&gt;&gt; output
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Neither of these examples has a return value, but we will usually want to have a return value unless the function is our ‚Äúmain‚Äù function or carries out a ‚Äúside-effect‚Äù like printing. If we don‚Äôt explicitly declare a return value, then the result will be None (as you saw when our body used print).</p>

<p>We can declare what we‚Äôre returning from a function using the return keyword:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def add_two(num):
...     return num + 2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = add_two(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result
4
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="working-with-multiple-parameters">Working with Multiple Parameters</h3>

<p>When we have a function that takes multiple parameters, we need to separate them using commas and give them unique names:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(num1, num2):
...     return num1 + num2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = add(1, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result
6
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="parameters-vs-arguments">Parameters vs. Arguments</h2>

<p>When talking about functions, the words ‚Äúparameter‚Äù and ‚Äúargument‚Äù are often used interchangeably. But they represent two different things. In this lesson, we‚Äôll look at the differences between parameters and arguments, and the different ways we can use arguments when calling functions.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-for-this-video-1">Documentation For This Video</h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions">Defining Functions</a></p>

<h3 id="parameters-vs-aruguments">Parameters VS Aruguments</h3>

<p>The difference between a parameter and an argument is all about timing. When we‚Äôre working with the definition of a function, then the variables defined in the function declaration are the ‚Äúparameters.‚Äù When we‚Äôre calling the function, the data that we provide for each parameter is the ‚Äúargument.‚Äù Accidentally using these words interchangeably in practice isn‚Äôt an issue, because other programmers will know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about. But it is good to know that there is a distinction.</p>

<p>With the semantic differences covered, we‚Äôre ready to move onto the more interesting topic of the various types of arguments that we can use: position and keyword arguments.</p>

<h2 id="using-keyword-arguments">Using Keyword Arguments</h2>

<p>Every function call we‚Äôve made up to this point has used what are known as positional arguments. But if we know the name of the parameters, and not necessarily the positions, we can all them all using keyword arguments like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def contact_card(name, age, car_model):
...     return f"{name} is {age} and drives a {car_model}"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; contact_card("Keith", 29, "Honda Civic")
'Keith is 29 and drives a Honda Civic'
&gt;&gt;&gt; contact_card(age=29, car_model="Civic", name="Keith")
'Keith is 29 and drives a Civic'
&gt;&gt;&gt; contact_card("Keith", car_model="Civic", age="29")
'Keith is 29 and drives a Civic'
&gt;&gt;&gt; contact_card(age="29", "Keith", car_model="Civic")
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we‚Äôre using position and keyword arguments, every argument after the first keyword argument must also be a keyword argument. It‚Äôs sometimes useful to mix them, but oftentimes we‚Äôll use either all positional or all keyword.</p>

<h3 id="defining-parameters-with-default-arguments">Defining Parameters with Default Arguments</h3>

<p>Along with being able to use keyword arguments when we‚Äôre calling a function, we‚Äôre able to define default values for parameters to make them optional when the information is commonly known and the same. To do this, we use the assignment operator (=) when we‚Äôre defining the parameter:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def can_drive(age, driving_age=16):
...     return age &gt;= driving_age
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; can_drive(16)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; can_drive(16, driving_age=18)
False
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Parameters with default arguments need to go at the end of the parameters list when defining the function so that positional arguments can still be used to call the function.</p>

<h2 id="recursion">Recursion</h2>

<p>It might not seem immediately obvious, but we‚Äôre capable of calling a function from within itself. This practice is called recursion. In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn how we can use recursion and some of the pitfalls that surround it.</p>

<h3 id="solving-problems-with-recursion">Solving Problems with Recursion</h3>

<p>Recursion is the practice of calling a function from within itself. This might not seem like something that you‚Äôd ever do at first, but occasionally the best way to solve a problem is to break it up into smaller versions of the same problem. The canonical example of this is calculating the Fibonacci Sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.). In the Fibonacci sequence, the next number is always the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. If we write this out as a mathematical function, then calculating the nth item in the Fibonacci sequence would look something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>f(n) = f(n-2) + f(n-1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, for the 5th item in the sequence (which coincidently is also 5), we would expand it like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>f(5) = f(3) + f(4)
f(5) = f(1) + f(2) + f(2) + f(3)
f(5) = 1 + f(0) + f(1) + f(0) + f(1) + f(1) + f(2)
f(5) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + f(0) + f(1)
f(5) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1
f(5) = 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For recursion to work, there has to be what is called a ‚Äúbase case,‚Äù where something is returned other than the result of the function calling itself. In the case of our Fibonacci sequence function, the base case(s) are that f(0) will return 0, and f(1) will return 1. Now that we can visualize exactly what is going on, let‚Äôs write this function in Python:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/fib.py

def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)

item_to_calculate = int(input("What Fibonnaci item would you like to calculate? "))

print(fib(item_to_calculate))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In writing our function, we needed to remember a few things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We need to handle the base cases first.</li>
  <li>We return what we would normally consider the implementation of the function. This return allows us to essentially gather all of the results at the end.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let‚Äôs run our script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 fib.py
What Fibonacci item would you like to calculate? 15
610
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That was pretty fast, but as we increase the number from 15 to 30, we should see it take significantly longer to return. This is because the number of recursive function calls that happen as we try to calculate higher and higher terms gets excessively large. Trying to calculate the 50th term using our implementation might not ever return.</p>

<h3 id="the-limits-of-recursion">The Limits of Recursion</h3>

<p>We‚Äôve run into the main issue with recursion, every time we recurse it, we‚Äôre adding more and more function calls to the stack of calls that need to be completed. Some languages are optimized to handle this by implementing something called ‚Äútail-call optimization,‚Äù but Python is not one of those languages. Recursion is a useful tool at times, but it does require being delicate and layering in some manual optimization (which we won‚Äôt be covering here).</p>

<h2 id="generators">Generators</h2>

<h2 id="creating-and-using-generators">Creating and Using Generators</h2>

<p>Normal functions are the primary way that we‚Äôll be bundling up logic that we want to use over and over, but Python also provides a way for us to define functions that behave like iterators. These functions are called ‚Äúgenerators.‚Äù In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn why we might want to use generators and how to create and use them.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-for-this-video-3">Documentation For This Video</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">Python Wiki: Generators</a>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#next">The Built-In next Function</a></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-generator">What is a Generator?</h3>

<p>A generator is a function that behaves like an iterator. This means that we can ask a generator function for its ‚Äúnext‚Äù value and it will calculate it, and return it to us. Similar to how a range doesn‚Äôt calculate all of the values at once, a generator function essentially ‚Äúpauses‚Äù its execution after returning a single result until the next result is requested.</p>

<p>To learn about generators, let‚Äôs go ahead and implement a function that works like the built-in range type.</p>

<h3 id="writing-a-generator-function">Writing a Generator Function</h3>

<p>Generator functions are defined the same way that traditional functions are, except that instead of using the return keyword to provide a result back to the caller, we use the keyword yield. When defining a generator, we will almost always include a loop in the body of the function, and then we‚Äôll yield from within the loop. Let‚Äôs create a new file called gen.py to create our gen_range function.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def gen_range(stop, start=1, step=1):
    num = start
    while num &lt;= stop:
        yield num
        num += step
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unlike the built-in range function, if we call this function with three arguments, they‚Äôre in the order of stop, start, and step instead of starting with start. But this function effectively works the same way (although not as performant). Let‚Äôs load our file into the REPL to test out this function:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 -i gen.py
&gt;&gt;&gt; gen_range(10)
&lt;generator object gen_range at 0x1054a8550&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first thing to note, is that when we call the generator function, it returns a generator object to us instead of giving us the result. To get each result, we‚Äôll use the built-in next function to execute the generator until it hits a yield statement. Let‚Äôs assign the generator object to a variable and pass it to next a few times:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; generator = gen_range(4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(generator)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(generator)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(generator)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is how a generator works. It loops internally, yielding a result each time it‚Äôs passed to the next function until it reaches the end of the function because it stops looping. Here‚Äôs what we see if we pass the generator to next too many times:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; next(generator)
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(generator)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
StopIteration
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In practice, we won‚Äôt normally be calling the next function on our generators. We‚Äôll be using them with for loops like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for num in gen_range(10, step=2):
...     print(num)
...
1
3
5
7
9
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The for loop automatically knows how to work with generators, so we don‚Äôt have to worry about running into the StopIteration error.</p>

<h2 id="converting-generators-to-lists">Converting Generators to Lists</h2>

<p>Generators are functions that behave like iterators, and that means that they can be used to dynamically calculate items in a loop. But that also means that they can be converted into lists. In this lesson, we‚Äôll take a look when and how we can convert a generator into a list.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-for-this-video-4">Documentation For This Video</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">Python Wiki: Generators</a>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#next">The Built-In next Function</a></p>

<h3 id="converting-a-generator-to-a-list">Converting a Generator to a List</h3>

<p>When we‚Äôre working with generators, we‚Äôll often write them in such a way that eventually they won‚Äôt have anything left to yield. And in that case, we can turn the generator into a list. This might sound like it would be difficult, but it‚Äôs as easy as passing the generator object into the list function that we‚Äôve used many times before, to convert things like dict_keys objects to be lists.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs load our gen.py file into the REPL again so that we can utilize the gen_range function that we wrote in the previous lecture:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 -i gen.py
&gt;&gt;&gt; generator = gen_range(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(generator)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That was pretty simple. But, it is possible to run into issues with this. Let‚Äôs say that we define an infinite generator that will always calculate the next item in the Fibonacci sequence we looked at in our recursion lesson.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gen.py

def gen_range(stop, start=1, step=1):
    num = start
    while num &lt;= stop:
        yield num
        num += step

def gen_fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        a, b = b, a + b
        yield a
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function might look a little weird, but to calculate the next item in the Fibonacci sequence, we combine the previous two items with 0 and 1 being our two starting points. This should yield us 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. as we continue to call next on an instance of this generator object:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 -i gen.py
&gt;&gt;&gt; fib = gen_fib()
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(fib)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(fib)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(fib)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(fib)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(fib)
5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We‚Äôll never reach the end of this generator function because it includes an infinite loop, and we never use a break statement. Let‚Äôs see what happens if we try to turn this into a list (don‚Äôt follow along with this):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(fib)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We‚Äôll see that the prompt hangs. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs looping forever. This is the situation when you can‚Äôt convert a generator to be a list because the list function will never return.</p>

<h2 id="scoping">Scoping</h2>

<h2 id="python-scopes">Python Scopes</h2>

<p>We‚Äôve lightly touched on this already, but when working with any programming language, the variables and objects that we‚Äôre working with are only accessible within certain scopes. In this lesson, we‚Äôll take a closer look at how scopes work and when our variables might not be what we expect them to be.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-scope">What is a Scope?</h3>

<p>When we say that we‚Äôre working in a different ‚Äúscope‚Äù in Python, we mean that we‚Äôre within the boundaries of a function or a class. This is important because while within the body of a function or class, the variables that we create are not automatically accessible outside of that context. Let‚Äôs create a new file called scopes.py so that we can experiment with how scopes work. To start, let‚Äôs see how variables work when dealing with conditionals and loops.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>scopes.py

if 1 &lt; 2:
    x = 5

while x &lt; 6:
    print(x)
    x += 1

print(x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we‚Äôre creating a variable (x=5) within the body of a conditional (if 1 &lt; 2:1). Afterward, we attempt to access that variable within the context of a loop (while x &lt; 6:) and at the highest level of our script. Will this work? Let‚Äôs find out by running this through the interpreter:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 scopes.py
5
6
$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We didn‚Äôt run into an error because conditionals and loops do not create scopes. Now, let‚Äôs change our conditional to be a function instead.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>scopes.py

def set_x():
    x = 5

set_x()

while x &lt; 6:
    print(x)
    x += 1

print(x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now if we run this we‚Äôll see the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 scopes.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "scopes.py", line 7, in &amp;lt;module&gt;
    while x &lt; 6:
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see this error because x is defined within the set_x function and only exists during the execution of the function.</p>

<h2 id="name-hiding-shadowing">Name Hiding (Shadowing)</h2>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve looked at how scopes work initially, we‚Äôre ready to look at what happens when we have a function parameter that is the same as a variable that exists at a higher level. This is sometimes called shadowing or name hiding.</p>

<h3 id="name-hiding-in-action">Name Hiding in Action</h3>

<p>We know that functions create scopes. But, what happens when a parameter name is the same as a variable that has already been defined? Let‚Äôs continue using scopes.py to see what happens when we set y before we define the set_x function, and then change our function to have a y parameter:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>scopes.py

y = 5

def set_x(y):
    print("Inner y:", y)
    x = y
    y = x

set_x(10)
print("Outer y:", y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now if we run this, we‚Äôll see the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 scopes.py
Inner y: 10
Outer y: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since our function defines the y parameter, it‚Äôs as though the outer y variable doesn‚Äôt exist within the set_x function. Name hiding makes it possible for us to be confident that our parameters won‚Äôt be affected by values at a higher scope. That doesn‚Äôt mean that name hiding is something that we should always use though because it can make our code a little harder for people to understand.</p>
