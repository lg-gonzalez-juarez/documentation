<p>scikit-image is an open-source package for image processing. It has a wide range of algorithms that allow you to process your images. Documentation can be found <a href="https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we are going to take a look at how to load an image into scikit-image and examine the NumPy array that results.</p>

<p>Installation
To install scikit-image:</p>

<p>python -m pip install scikit-image
Loading an Image
First, we need to get the photo we are planning to use. In this case, the photo is one I took of some flowers.</p>

<p>curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-using-pythons-maths-science-and-engineering-libraries/master/flowers.jpg
/home/cloud_user/notebooks/lesson1.py</p>

<h1>%%</h1>
<p>import numpy as np
from skimage import io</p>

<p>img = io.imread(‚Äòflowers.jpg‚Äô)
io.imshow(img)
type(img)
img.shape
We should make a backup of the picture before proceeding. The file extension (.jpg, .tiff) tells Jupyter the format in which it will be saved.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs make a backup of the picture:</p>

<p>io.imsave(‚Äúimg_bup.jpg‚Äù, img)
io.imsave(‚Äúimg_bup.tiff‚Äù, img)</p>
