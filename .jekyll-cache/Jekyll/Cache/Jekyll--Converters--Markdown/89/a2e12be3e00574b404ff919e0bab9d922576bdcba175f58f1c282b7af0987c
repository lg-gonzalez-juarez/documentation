<p>As we start digging into sequence types like strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, we need to start thinking about the mutability of a type or whether or not it can change. Normally, weâ€™ll talk about whether or not a type is â€œimmutable,â€ meaning that it canâ€™t be changed, and most of the types weâ€™ve looked at thus far are immutable.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-immutability-matter">Why Does Immutability Matter?</h3>

<p>Immutability is something that we donâ€™t always have to think about, but it does matter in a few very common cases:</p>

<h3 id="understanding-why-we-cant-modify-a-string-in-place">Understanding why we canâ€™t modify a string in-place</h3>

<p>Using objects as keys for dictionaries (weâ€™ll get to this later)
Weâ€™ll cover dictionaries in a different section, but when it comes to strings, wanting to modify a string variable is fairly common. Strings are an immutable type in Python, so we canâ€™t change a string object. We can only create new strings with the modifications that we wanted. This means that the only way for us to change the string value of a variable is to explicitly reassign it. As we learn about mutable types, weâ€™ll see that other types allow us to modify the value of a variable without explicitly reassigning it.</p>

<h3 id="immutability-of-strings">Immutability of Strings</h3>

<p>When looking at str class there are many methods that return a str to us, such as capitalize:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str = 'testing'
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str.capitalize()
'Testing'
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str
'testing'
</code></pre>
<p>We wonâ€™t find a method that changes the value of my_str in this example. Beyond this, each unique string that we can only type will only exist once in memory. In our case, we referenced the literal â€˜testingâ€™ when we assigned the value to our variable, and if we ever use the literal of â€˜testingâ€™ again it will point to the same point in memory, because that value canâ€™t be modified.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; id(my_str)
4522355248
&gt;&gt;&gt; id('testing')
4522355248
</code></pre>
<p>This feature prevents the same value being allocated more than once and taking up more spots in our computerâ€™s memory than we need it to.</p>
