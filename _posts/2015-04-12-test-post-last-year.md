Consortium to develop electric regional aircraft for Norway by 2026

The project expands on the successful research programme between Rolls-Royce and Widerøe on sustainable aviation and the existing partnership between Rolls-Royce and Tecnam on powering the all-electric P-Volt aircraft.


Honeywell is developing a 1MW generator suitable for use in hybrid-electric aircraft 

The turbogenerator is a combination of a  Honeywell 1MW generator and HGT1700 auxiliary power unit, which is currently flown on every Airbus A350 XWB. The 280 lbs (127kg) power unit will be able to run on biofuel, jet fuel and diesel and is designed to provide power to high-power electric motors or batteries in heavy-lift cargo drones, air taxis and commuter aircraft.

Honeywell unveiled its first turbogenerator for urban air mobility (UAM) at the 2019 HAI HELI-EXPO in Atlanta. It combined Honeywell’s HTS900 turboshaft engine with two 200-kilowatt generators.
